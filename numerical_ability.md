### LCM and HCF

- $\text{LCM of fractions} = \large{\frac{\text{LCM of numerators}}{\text{HCF of denominators}}}$

- $\text{HCF of fractions} = \large{\frac{\text{HCF of numerators}}{\text{LCM of denominators}}}$

- $\text{A.B} = \text{HCF(A, B)}.\text{LCM(A, B)}$

- If remainder is given, see if adding or subtracting it from LCM/HCF according to question makes sense.

- Includes questions with keywords like find "maximum/greatest" or "minimum/least" etc.

### Simplification

- $(a + b)^3 = a^3 + b^3 + 3ab(a + b)$
- $(a - b)^3 = a^3 - b^3 - 3ab(a-b)$
- $a^3 + b^3 = (a+b)(a^2+b^2-ab)$
- $a^3 - b^3 = (a-b)(a^2+b^2+ab)$
- $(a+b+c)^2 = (a^2 + b^2 + c^2) + 2(ab+bc+ca)$
- $a^3 + b^3 + c^3 -3abc = (a+b+c)(a^2+b^2+c^2-ab-bc-ca)$
- Use things like rationalization, taking common from repeating series etc to simplify.

### Fractions

- Convert repeating numbers to fraction -

  - $\text{0.35}\overline{23}$ = $\large{\frac{\text{Whole number once} - \text{Digits after decimal not repeating}}{\text{9 m times followed by 0 n times}} = \frac{3523 - 35}{9900} = \frac{3488}{9900}}$ where m = Number of digits after decimal(non repeating) and n = Number of digits after decimal(repeating)

- If $\large{\frac{a}{b} = \frac{c}{d}}$, then $\large{\frac{a+b}{a-b} = \frac{c+d}{c-d}}$ by Componendo-Dividendo rule.

- Solving complex decimal equations -

  - Eg - $105.153 - 4.142 - 100.8 - 0.053$ can be solved by first calculating all numbers before decimal and then solving all after decimal.
  - $105 - 4 - 100 - 0 = 1$
  - $153 - 142 - 800 - 053 = -842$ but since its after decimal it will $-0.842$
  - $1 - 0.842 = 0.158$

- Finding largest/smallest fraction -

  - Consider two fractions, cross multiply them and compare result. If LHS > RHS, left fraction is greater else right. For multiple fractions, form pairs, get largest/smallest from all pairs and then compare those to find global largest/smallest.

- Finding increasing order of fractions -

  - If $deno > nume$ and $deno - nume$ is **SAME** and consisent among fractions, we say that **SMALLER THE NUMERATOR, SMALLER THE FRACTION. GREATER THE NUMERATOR, GREATER THE FRACTION**
  - If after arranging the numerators in ascending order, the $nume$ and $deno$ increases by fixed values, we say that **SMALLER THE NUMERATOR, SMALLER THE FRACTION. GREATER THE NUMERATOR, GREATER THE FRACTION**. The values by which num. and denom. increase might or might not be same.

- Solving mixed fractions -
  - Eg - $\large{8\frac{1}{6} + 5\frac{1}{8} + 4\frac{2}{3}}$ can be solved by first calculating all numbers sepeartely and then solving all fractions.
  - $8 + 5 + 4 = 17$
  - $\large{\frac{1}{6} + \frac{1}{8} + \frac{2}{3} = \frac{23}{24}}$
  - $\text{Ans} = 17\frac{23}{24}$
